Microbiome analysis of Aedes aegypti 

This scripts hereing contained were useed for the analysis of whole-genome shotgun short reads of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Salgado et al)

This repo includes the following steps:

Filtering the microbial community matrix
Extracting reads for specific taxa from fastq files
Dimensionality reduction and regression of samples and experimental groups
Calculating microbial association to experimental variables
Microbial co-occurrence analyses
